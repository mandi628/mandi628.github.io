## About Me

This page is my portfolio of projects. I am a perpetual student, always working to learn more. Feel free to look around and check out the websites I've designed. The [Upstate Suzuki Academy site](http:/www.upstatesuzukiacademy.com) is the first site I designed for my music teaching business, and was made with Wordpress, however all the photos and the color templates are original. All my other website and webpage samples have been built from scratch, either as client work or as learning projects, as I continue on my journey as a web developer.

## Contact
