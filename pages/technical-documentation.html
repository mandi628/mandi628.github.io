                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Technical Documentation pages are typically used for instructional material in the dev industry. For filler content, I used this instructional material instead. Client is reposible for creating their own content. As a developer, my job is making it look good.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="General_Content">
                    <header>General Content</header>
                    <p>The first thing you want to figure out when creating a website, is what general content you want to have. Is the main purpose of the site to sell a product? Inform potential customers? Educate the public on something? Share news? A website can do all of these things, and it grow into more than your original plan, but you have to have a starting place.</p>
                    <p>As you think about these things, start creating a list of individual pages you will want to have in your webiste. Consider these, as the bare minimum:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Home Page</strong> - This is where your audience will land when they type in your URL.</li>
                        <li><strong>About Page</strong> - This page describes who you are and what your purpose is for creating your site. It can be a section of the homepage, instead of a separate page, but your web developer will want to include it in your navigation links on your Home Page.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Page</strong> - This is crucial to a successful webpage. You want a way for your readers to contact you with questions or to purchase your product. Again, this can be a section on your Home Page that will be linked in your navigation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="Home_Page">
                    <header>Home Page</header>
                    <p>The <strong>Home Page</strong> is the front page your audience will see when accessing your URL. This is where you want to make your best first impression. There are a lot of layouts to choose from, so look around and see if you can find any you like. Your web developer may have some templates you can choose from.</p>
                    <p>You'll want to include a few things on your <strong>Home Page</strong>. We mentioned a few above:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>About Information</li>
                        <li>Contact Information</li>
                        <li>Product Links or Summaries</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But you may also want to include a Blog or News feed, photos of you or your product, videos. You want to keep it simple, but you want to engage the reader to get them to click through to other pages on your site.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="About_Page">
                    <header>About Page</header>
                    <p>Your <strong>About Page</strong> is a great place to tell your story. If you have an About Section on your Home Page, you'll want to keep that short and sweet (about 50-75 words). But your About Page is where you can go into more detail.</p>
                    <p>You may not want to tell your life story, unless it's relevant to the topic of your site, but you can include anything you want here. A lot of About Pages include photos, videos, and other details. You might outline your education, or include a timeline of your product development or company formation.</p>
                    <p>If this site is for a company, you'll want to remember that you are speaking for the entity here, and not you personally. Although you might also use the About page as a quick company directory - each key person in the company can have a short bio, or you could even link to bios for each department. The possibiltiies are endless.</p>
                    <p>Which ever way you go, this section of your website is a place to go into detail with your reader on what your, or your company, are there for.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="Section_Four">
                    <header>Section Four</header>
                    <p>Paragraph 8 is nice and simple. Navigation is added by using the <code>nav</code> element.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="main-section" id="Section_Five">
                    <header>Section Five</header>
                    <p>Then there's paragraph 9.</p>
                    <p>And finally 10. And unordered or numbered lists are controlled with <code>li</code> elements.</p>
